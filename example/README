To run the example:

1)  Install the daemonx module.  You can run "sudo python setup.py develop" to
do that.

2)  Make the directory "/etc/daemonx' and copy daemonx.conf into it.  Make
the file readable by your user.  Put your username after "user =" in the first
section.  This is the user the daemons will run as.

3)  Make the directory "/var/run/daemonx" and make it writable by your user.

There are two ways to start/stop/restart the two example daemons.

1)  Run the scripts in the example directory.  So, for example,
"./daemonx-daemon1 start" will start the first example daemon.

2)  Run the daemonx script in the ~/bin directory.  So, for example,
"daemonx /etc/daemonx/daemonx.conf daemon1 start" will start the first
example daemon.

The daemons respond to the commands start, stop, restart, and run_once.
